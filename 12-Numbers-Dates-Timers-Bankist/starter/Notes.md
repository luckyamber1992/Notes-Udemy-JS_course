# NaN
- Number.isNaN()
NaN is a global property in JavaScript that is of the data type "number". It indicates a value that is not a valid numeric result. When a calculation or operation produces a value that cannot be expressed as a meaningful number, NaN is returned.

Here are a few examples that result in NaN:

> console.log(Math.sqrt(-1)); // Output: NaN
> console.log(0 / 0); // Output: NaN
> console.log(parseInt('Hello')); // Output: NaN

# isFinite
only a number which is nither an infinity nor a NaN can return true

# isInteger
 It checks if the value is a finite number and has no fractional or decimal part.
